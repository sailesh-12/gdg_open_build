# 🏦 AnchorRisk  
### Household-Aware Financial Risk & Loan Decision Support System

---

## 📌 Overview

**AnchorRisk** is a fintech decision-support platform that evaluates **loan risk by analyzing household financial structures**, not just individual income.

Traditional credit systems assess applicants in isolation.  
AnchorRisk models **how financial stress propagates through a household**, revealing hidden fragility that often causes loan defaults.

This project was built as a **hackathon MVP** with a focus on:
- Explainability
- Real-world banking logic
- Privacy-first design
- Practical risk insights

## 🎯 Problem Statement

> *Loans are issued to individuals, but defaults occur due to household obligations.*

Existing systems fail to capture:
- Dependency chains
- Income concentration risk
- Cascading financial stress

AnchorRisk addresses this gap using **graph modeling + ML-based fragility analysis**.
