AnchorRisk is a fintech decision-support system that evaluates loan risk by analyzing household financial structures, not just individual income.

Traditional credit systems assess applicants in isolation.
AnchorRisk models how financial stress propagates through a household, revealing hidden fragility that leads to loan defaults.

Loans are issued to individuals, but defaults occur due to household obligations.

AnchorRisk addresses this gap by:

Modeling households as dependency graphs

Simulating income shocks

Separating structural risk from loan affordability

Providing clear explanations and safeguards
