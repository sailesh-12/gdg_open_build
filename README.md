# 🏦 AnchorRisk  
### Household-Aware Financial Risk & Loan Decision Support System

---

## 📌 Overview

**AnchorRisk** is a fintech decision-support platform that evaluates **loan risk by analyzing household financial structures**, not just individual income.

Traditional credit systems assess applicants in isolation.  
AnchorRisk models **how financial stress propagates through a household**, revealing hidden fragility that often causes loan defaults.

This project was built as a **hackathon MVP** with a focus on:
- Explainability
- Real-world banking logic
- Privacy-first design
- Practical risk insights

## 🎯 Problem Statement

> *Loans are issued to individuals, but defaults occur due to household obligations.*

Existing systems fail to capture:
- Dependency chains
- Income concentration risk
- Cascading financial stress

AnchorRisk addresses this gap using **graph modeling + ML-based fragility analysis**.

- Identifies single points of failure
- Outputs explainable risk bands (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH)

### 3️⃣ Stress Simulation
- Simulates income loss **without removing people**
- Preserves household obligations
- Shows how risk propagates across the graph

### 4️⃣ Loan Affordability Check
- Uses applicant’s monthly income
- Applies EMI ≤ 40% income rule
- Determines if a requested loan is affordable

### 5️⃣ Decision Support Output
- APPROVE / CONDITIONAL APPROVE / REJECT
